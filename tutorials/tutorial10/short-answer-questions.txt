Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?

A join links data from two or more tables using a common column. It's helpful because it allows you to retrieve related info from different tables in a single query thus avoiding data duplication


2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?

A foreign key improves effciency by preventing the repition of user details in each post, which saves storage space and helps maintain orgnaized data
